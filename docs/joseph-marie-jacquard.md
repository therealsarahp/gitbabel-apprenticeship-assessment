# Joseph-Marie Jacquard

The automatic loom, the driving force behind the revolution in the textile industry, was the brainchild of the French inventor Joseph-Marie Jacquard. He worked on the idea in 1790 and demonstrated his improved draw loom in 1801. 

It did take more than a decade, but only because his progress was cut short by the French Revolution during which he fought for the Revolutionaries.

Jacquard continued his work and ended up creating an attachment to make the loom even better in 1804. After which, any loom that used the attachment was called a Jacquard loom. One special thing about the Jacquard loom is its programmability. Not only did it revolutionize the textile industry, but it also became one of the earliest versions of a programmable machine. 

In 1806, the Jacquard loom was declared public property and the man who invented it was rewarded with royalties and a pension.
