# Johannes Guttenberg

The invention of paper allowed humans to make notes and record history without spending too much money on silk, so it made the process of passing on knowledge to the next generation much more affordable. However, it was the invention of the printing press that completely changed the world. As a matter of fact, many people say that Johannes Guttenbergâ€™s printing press is the most important invention of all time.

One of the unique components of his design was the use of matrices to cast types with excellent accuracy and in large quantities. He also incorporated other elements already available for him such as oil-based ink, papermaking, bookbinding, and wine-making. He started designing a new printing press in 1439, and he managed to use it to print the famous Forty-two-line Bible by 1455. More than 200 million books were printed using his printing presses by 1600.
