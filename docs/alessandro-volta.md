# Alessandro Volta

Alessandro Volta came up with the first true battery known as a voltaic pile. Voltaâ€™s device was able to store and produce a continuous steady current of electricity as well as retain most of its power even when not in use over time. Volta started working on static electricity in 1780 and constructed the voltaic pile in 1800. The unit of electromotive force called a volt was derived from his name and coined in 1881.
