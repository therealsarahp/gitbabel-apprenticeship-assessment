# Charles Babbage

Two things separated Charles Babbage from every other mathematician and engineer in his lifetime: the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine — both were his projects. 

## Difference Engine

While the Difference Engine was the less sophisticated of the two, it could put any calculator available back then to shame. It was a glorified mechanical calculator with the ability to construct a mathematical table, more specifically logarithm tables for navigational purpose.

The engine could also print results onto a soft metal plate. Between 1985 and 2002, British scientists built the engine and you can still see it now at the Science Museum in London.

## Analytical Engine

On the other hand, the Analytical Engine should have been the first computer. It had a mill (CPU), storage to hold data prior to processing (memory), reader, and printer. It was a forgotten design until Babbage’s notebooks were published in 1937.
