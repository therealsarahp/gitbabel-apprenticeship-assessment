# John Wesley Hyatt

The first practical form of artificial plastic was celluloid, of which the manufacturing process was discovered by John Wesley Hyatt. 

He took an interest when a billiards company based in New York offered a $10,000 reward for anybody who could invent a material satisfactory-enough to substitute ivory to make billiard balls. 

While he did not manage to get the reward, he and his brother Isiah continued experimenting and found the right combination of substances to make a very versatile material called celluloid.

Hyatt used a mixture of nitrocellulose, camphor, and alcohol and then pressed it in a heated mold. Colors, both transparent and opaque, could be added later in the process when the material was kneaded.
