# Alfred Nobel

Mostly recognized as the founder of the Noble Prizes, Alfred Bernhard Nobel had two other notable inventions: explosive detonation of nitroglycerin and dynamite. During the late 1850s, the most powerful yet relatively safe explosive for use in mines was the black powder. Nitroglycerin was known about at that time, but it was so powerful that nobody knew how to detonate it from a safe distance.

In 1863, Nobel invented a practical method of detonation by using a wooden stick inserted into a metal container filled with a large charge of nitroglycerin. The stick had a small charge of black powder intended to start a chain reaction that would eventually explode the entire container. Just four years later, Nobel figured out a method to contain nitroglycerin in a more stable state. When exposed to a material known as kieselguhr (a siliceous sedimentary rock), nitroglycerin was absorbed, and the resulting mixture became safer to handle. He was granted the patent for it in 1868 (United States) and 1868 (Great Britain).
