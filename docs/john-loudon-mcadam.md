# John Loudon McAdam

> He was the inventor of "macadamisation", an effective and economical method of constructing roads.

In 1815, when John Loudon McAdam held the position of surveyor general of the Bristol roads, he had the perfect opportunity to put his road-building ideas into practice. Instead of utilizing the commonly-used masonry construction approach, he demonstrated that a thin layer of broken stones compacted on a well-drained natural formation could support traffic as long as the thin layer was covered by an impermeable surface of smaller stones. Drainage was crucial to make the design effective, so the pavement must be elevated above the surrounding surface. 

Many other countries including the United States quickly adopted the same method; in fact, it is still used until today.
