# Eli Whitney

Many people remember Eli Whitney as the inventor of the cotton gin, but his most important contribution to the entire manufacturing industry was the idea of mass production of interchangeable parts. He was an inventor, manufacturer, and an engineer who made a lot of money from the settlement of patent infringement issues regarding his patent on cotton gin.

Their device was all mechanical and consisted of:

1. a hopper to feed the cotton into the gin;

2. a cylinder fitted with hundreds of short wire hooks arranged in a way that they matched the grooves;

3. breastwork with a narrow slot too small to allow the passage of cotton seeds;

4. a bristle to brush the cotton from the hooks. The patent for this device was granted in 1794. Whitney and Miller accumulated around $90,000 for patent rights alone.
