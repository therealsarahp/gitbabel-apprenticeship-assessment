# Alois Senefelder

Nicéphore Niépce probably wouldn’t have moved on to photography if Johann Nepomuk Franz Alois Senefelder of Germany hadn’t kept the method a secret. Senefelder wanted to publish plays he had written, but he didn’t have enough money to purchase printing plates. So, he did what inventors do: he built one.

It occurred to him that etching the rest of the surface transformed the markings into reliefs. His works on copper plates were unsuccessful, but it led him to experiment on limestone. After two years of trial and error, he discovered flat-surface printing. Senefelder did not disclose his method to the public until at least 1818. In later years, he accepted an offer from Johann Anton André to train others about the lithographic process. The king of Bavaria also gave him a good pension.
