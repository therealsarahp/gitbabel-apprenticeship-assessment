# Gertrude B. Elion

In 1944, Gertrude Elion joined the Burroughs Welcome Laboratories and met with George H. Hitchings. They worked together for the next 40 years, during which they developed several drugs that effectively treated various diseases including autoimmune disorder, gout, urinary tract infection, viral herpes, malaria, and leukemia. 

Instead of using trial-and-error, they eliminated the guesswork by first examining the difference between normal and cancer cells as well as viruses, bacteria, and pathogens. Based on the findings from the examination, they formulated drugs to inhibit the development of pathogens without damaging normal cells.
