# Christiaan Huygens

A Dutch astronomer, physicist, and mathematician, Christiaan Huygens was responsible for many important scientific discoveries including the wave theory of light, discovering the true shape of the ring of Saturn, and uncovering the science of dynamics (action of forces on bodies). His most popular invention was the practical application of the pendulum as a time controller in clocks. His pendulum clock came into existence in 1656 and the patent for it was granted a year later.

Many consider Huygens a greatly-talented mathematician rather than a genius of the first order. Isaac Newton admired him mainly for Huygens’ preference for synthetic methods of experimentations. It’s ironic that much of Huygens’ works on light and dynamics was overshadowed by those of Newtons throughout the 18th century.
