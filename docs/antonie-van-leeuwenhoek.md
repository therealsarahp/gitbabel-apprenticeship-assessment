# Antonie van Leeuwenhoek

Having a specialization in microscopy, the Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is credited for discovering bacteria, blood cells, and all things microscopic. His observation laid the foundation for modern fields of science including protozoology and biology. He made his own microscope using a high-quality lens with a short focal length.

At that time, this design was preferable to a compound microscope because the former eliminated the problems with chromatic aberration. Despite the lack of organization commonly present in formal scientific research, Leeuwenhoekâ€™s careful observation led him to important discoveries. Among them was the structure of the flea along with the entire history of metamorphosis.
