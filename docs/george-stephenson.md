# George Stephenson

> Renowned as the "Father of Railways

After George Stephenson of England visited a colliery in 1813, mainly to observe something called a “steam boiler on wheels” constructed by John Blenkinsop, he figured that he could do better. He then built the _Blucher_, an engine equipped with enough power to haul 30 tons of coal at four miles per hour. Stephenson continued to improve the design and discovered a method to make a truly practical locomotive.

## Steam Power

The method involved redirecting exhaust steam up the chimney to increase the draft. When the first public railroad transportation became available, the train was pulled by Stephenson’s locomotive called _Active_ (widely known as _Locomotion_). It ran from Darlington to Stockton at the speed of 15 miles per hour carrying 450 passengers.
