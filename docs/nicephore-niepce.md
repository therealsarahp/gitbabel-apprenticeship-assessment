# Nicephore Niepce

The experiment to produce a permanent photographic image began in 1813 by a French inventor Nicéphore Niépce. Lithography was a popular hobby back in the country, so Niépce took interest in it only to find out that he was not skilled enough in drawing. Since he was unable to obtain lithographic stone locally, he decided to find a method to acquire or provide the images automatically. He started to use pewter covered with various light-sensitive materials to produce superimposed engravings in sunlight.

After three years of trials, he made attempts at photography (Niépce called it heliography or sun-drawing). Around 1826/1827, he used a camera to produce a view from his workroom on a pewter plate. In other words, the first photographic image from nature permanently fixed on a surface. He realized that metal was a better material of choice for etching because of its strength and durability.

In 1826, he made another heliograph but this one was a reproduction of an engraved portrait. With this heliograph, not only did he solve the problem of reproducing nature by light but also invented a method of photomechanical reproduction.
