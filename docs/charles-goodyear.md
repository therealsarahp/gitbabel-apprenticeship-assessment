# Charles Goodyear

As an inventor of an effective rubber tire design and its manufacturing method, Charles Goodyear had an unfortunate life due to patent infringement. Goodyear figured out that a mixture of rubber, sulfur, and white lead could be transformed into an elastic solid that would remain elastic even when exposed to high temperature. The vulcanization process used by Goodyear generally remains the same as it is today.

While his invention made good fortunes for many others (despite patent infringement issues), the inventor didnâ€™t get to enjoy the same luck. In fact, he left a debt of around $200,000 when he died. You can read about his account of the discovery in _Gum-Elastic and Its Discoveries_.
