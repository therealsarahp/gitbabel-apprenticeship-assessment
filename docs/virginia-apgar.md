# Virginia Apgar

Her biggest idea was the development of a medical approach to evaluate an infant immediately after birth to determine whether the newborn required medical intervention to improve chances of life. Until today, the Apgar Score System is still widely used all around the world. 

She made the first demonstration of the evaluation in 1952 based on five relatively simple observations on the infantâ€™s pulse rate, skin, activity, reflex irritability, and respiratory effort; all could be carried out within one minute after birth.
