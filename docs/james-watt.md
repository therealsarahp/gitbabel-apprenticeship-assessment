# James Watt

In 1764, while repairing the Newcomen steam engine, James Watt was impressed not by the engine itself but by the waste of steam it made. It took him about a year to come up with an ingenious solution to improve the efficiency of the engine: a separate condenser. It was his first and greatest invention.

Watt found that the worst defect of the Newcomen engine was the loss of latent heat in the process of creating energy. Therefore, the condensation — which caused the problem — should occur in a separate yet connected cylinder. With the help of John Roebuck and a loan from Joseph Black, James Watt made his own engine in 1768 and was granted the patent for his all-new improved steam engine design, one which eventually became the driving force behind the Industrial Revolution a year later.
