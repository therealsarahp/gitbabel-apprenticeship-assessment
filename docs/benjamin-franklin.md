# Benjamin Franklin

Benjamin Franklin was often illustrated as a man flying a kite in a thunderstorm, but this was not an original idea. A similar yet safer technique had been tried in France before. Many of his other discoveries were original nonetheless. Benjamin Franklin, also one of the Founding Fathers, created a clear distinction between electricity conductors and insulators, invented a battery for storing electric power, demonstrated that electricity was a single fluid with equal amounts of positive and negative charges, and coined many new words such as electrify, charge, discharge, armature, condense, and conductor.
