# Samuel F.B. Morse

Although the idea of the electric telegraph was invented around 1800, Samuel F.B. Morse believed that his proposal was the first. In 1837 and with the help of a friend who provided the materials and labor for developing the proposal, Morse built a model of the telegraph system. A year later, he developed a system of language consisting of dots and dashes known today as the Morse code.

Even during Morseâ€™s lifetime, his telegraph was continuously overshadowed by new technologies such as telephone, radio, and television. The code, however, remains a crucial system of communication especially for military purposes in situations when extremely long-distance communication is necessary. One of the main reasons is that receivers transmit simple tones in better clarity.
