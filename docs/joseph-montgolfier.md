# Joseph Montgolfier

The Montgolfier brothers were French pioneers who developed and performed the first un-tethered flights in a hot-air balloon. It all started in 1782 when the two discovered that heated air, collected inside a fabric bag, caused the bag to move up and fly. While it does sound simple, it took some serious work to figure out how to use it practically.

According to one story, albeit unproven, the brothers came up with the idea when they saw Joseph’s wife’s skirts billowed due to the heat generated by a charcoal burner. Finally, they made the first flight in public on June 4, 1783, in which they successfully flew up to 3,000 feet high and remained there for about 10 minutes. They settled to the ground about one and a half miles away from where they took off. The original design was continuously refined and improved, which opened the possibility for scientists to explore the upper atmosphere.
