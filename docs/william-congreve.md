# William Congreve

Based on earlier models of rockets used by Hayder Ali (an Indian prince) in 1792 and 1799, Sir William Congreve built a rocket with the capability of reaching a target located 2,000 yards away in 1805. The rocket was about 40.5 inches long and fitted with 16 feet of stabilizing stick. Congreve’s invention was used on many different occasions by the British. While he wasn’t the first to make rockets, his invention led to the enthusiastic utilization of black-powder rockets in Europe, especially for military purposes. Another idea of his was reinforcing warships with armor to withstand artillery fire.
