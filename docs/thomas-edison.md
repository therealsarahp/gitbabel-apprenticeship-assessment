# Thomas Alva Edison

With 1,093 U.S. patents registered under his name, Thomas Alva Edison was possibly the most serious inventor and businessman of all time. Starting his career in the telegraph industry in 1863, he continued to contribute to the modernization of electricity and its applications throughout his life.

Before he died in 1931, Edison successfully made many great ideas into reality. One of the most notable was the incandescent lamp, but there were many others too. For example, an electricity generator of unprecedented efficiency, electric railroad, commercial power system, and phonograph. 

In addition to all of those, Edison was the first to build a research laboratory of the industrial level.
